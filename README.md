Hello everyone! My name is Markus! I am 23 years old and I have been enjoying my time learning how to get better at my craft. My favorite hobbies are to get some exercise in and play basketball and also play video games in my free time! I want to learn more about becoming a software developer because it's appealing and i feel like i am very aware of what im doing! I pray I continue to grow and excel in this program!
